This is basically really, really good code.  I have a few comments:

email.js
  it might be nice to make the "fromEmail" string at line 17 into
    a "mailto:" clickable string so the user can more easily reply

client.js
  this seems kind of long by Uncle Bob standards, and it could use
    a few comments to indicate what some of the functions and the
    templates do;  The names are descriptive, though and that helps.

server.js
  generally NOT a great idea to put huge lists like this into functions,
    but it's mitigated by the fact it is read in at server "startup"
  some elaboration of the functions in comments would help, or at least
    move these to the top (if possible) so that the reader doesn't get
    the impression that the entire file is simply the list of domains
  some of the Meteor.methods..... have magic numbers, which isn't the
    optimal way of doing things; if there is a limit to something, it
    is better to say "STRING_LIMIT" than "1000".

All in all, you did a great job on this code, and it works as you
advertised it would.

Nice work!

Best of luck,
